# Calculator Using Javascript
A calculator implemented using JavaScript is a fundamental example of user interaction with web applications. It showcases the capabilities of JavaScript in handling user inputs, managing dynamic content, and performing basic calculations, serving as an educational tool and a practical utility for users needing quick arithmetic calculations.

## Functionality:
1.Display: The calculator provides a visual display showing the numbers, operators, and results of calculations.

2.Numeric Input: Users can input numbers by clicking on the respective number buttons.

3.Operators: Buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) allow users to perform arithmetic operations.

4.Clear and Delete: AC (All Clear) to clear the entire input or C (Clear) to delete the last entered digit or operator.

5.Equals (=): Calculates the result based on the entered expression and displays the output.



Certainly! A calculator built using JavaScript is a program that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically includes a user interface with buttons representing numbers, operators, and functions.

Functionality:
Display: The calculator provides a visual display showing the numbers, operators, and results of calculations.

Numeric Input: Users can input numbers by clicking on the respective number buttons.

Operators: Buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) allow users to perform arithmetic operations.

Clear and Delete: AC (All Clear) to clear the entire input or C (Clear) to delete the last entered digit or operator.

Equals (=): Calculates the result based on the entered expression and displays the output.

## How it works:
### Input Handling:
When a user clicks a button on the calculator, JavaScript captures this input and performs specific actions based on the button clicked.

### Display Updates: 
As the user enters numbers or operators, the display updates to reflect the input sequence.

### Expression Evaluation:
 When the user presses the equals (=) button, the JavaScript code evaluates the entered expression to compute the result.

### Error Handling: 
The calculator may include error handling for invalid inputs (such as division by zero) or malformed expressions.
